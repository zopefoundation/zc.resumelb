Bufferred Queues
================

The resumelb uses queues to interface between multiplexed worker
connections and client web connections.  For very large responses, you
could get into a situation where a worker sends data faster than a
client can recieve it and the data ends up in a queue in
memory. Specifically, this is the read queue used in a LB handler to
get data from the the worker.  The handler only pulls data from this
queue as fast as the WSGI server can send it to the client.  We don't
want this queue to get backed up, as that will back up other requests
on the **multiplexed** connection to the worker.

In the LB, handlers have BufferedQueue read queues.  A buffered queue
wraps a ByteSizedQueue and avoids blocking by writing data to a
temporary file, if necessary.

    >>> import zc.resumelb.util

    >>> q = zc.resumelb.util.BufferedQueue()

BufferedQueue only implements the ``put``, ``get``, and qsize queue methods.

    >>> q.put('a')
    >>> q.qsize()
    1
    >>> q.get()
    'a'
    >>> q.qsize()
    0

If it hasn't started bufferng yet, it doesn't have a close method:

    >>> hasattr(q, 'close')
    False

In testing, the underlying queue max size is only 999 bytes.

If we add 1000 bytes, we won't have triggered the buffering, due to
the fact that the underlying ByteSizedQueue doesn't block until the
bytes in the queue are over the limit:

    >>> q.put('a'*1000)
    >>> hasattr(q, 'close')
    False

    >>> q.put('b'*1000)
    >>> hasattr(q, 'close')
    True

Now, we've triggered the buffering. We can keep adding data:

    >>> q.put('c'*1000)
    >>> q.put('d'*1000)
    >>> q.put('e'*1000)
    >>> q.qsize()
    5000

without blocking.  We can verify that the ByteSizedQueue only has 1000
bytes by cheating. :)

    >>> q.queue.queue.qsize()
    1000

The rest is in the file buffer.  Let's drain the queue, to verify we
didn't lose anything.

    >>> q.get() == 'a'*1000
    True
    >>> q.get() == 'b'*1000
    True
    >>> q.get() == 'c'*1000
    True
    >>> q.get() == 'd'*1000
    True
    >>> q.get() == 'e'*1000
    True
    >>> q.qsize()
    0

Let's fill it up again:

    >>> q.put('f'*1000)
    >>> q.put('g'*1000)
    >>> q.put('h'*1000)
    >>> q.put('i'*1000)
    >>> q.put('j'*1000)

At any point, we can close the queue, which will free resources and
empty it:

    >>> q.close()
    >>> q.qsize()
    0

Being a little white box:

    >>> q.queue.file.closed
    True

Now, if we put to the queue, it will simply discard the data:

    >>> q.put('a')
    >>> q.qsize()
    0


Empty strings, None, and other False objects
--------------------------------------------

    >>> q = zc.resumelb.util.BufferedQueue()
    >>> q.put('')
    >>> q.qsize() > 0
    True
    >>> q.get()
    ''

    >>> q.qsize()
    0

    >>> q.put('a'*1000)
    >>> q.qsize()
    1000

    >>> q.put('')
    >>> q.put(None)
    >>> q.put(())
    >>> q.qsize()
    1000

    >>> q.get() == 'a'*1000, q.get(), q.get(), q.get()
    (True, '', None, ())
