Resume-based load balancer pool
===============================

The heart of the resume-based load balancer is the pool, which
implements the load balancing algorithm.  The pool has a collection of
workers organized according to their resumes.

The load balancer works by connecting to workers, creating local
workers for each connection, adding local workers to the pool, and
by accepting wsgi request, getting local workers from the pool and
passing the wsgi requests to the local workers, which, in term,
forwward the requests to the remote workers.

We'll test the pool with stand-ins for the local workers.

    >>> import zc.resumelb.lb
    >>> pool = zc.resumelb.lb.Pool(
    ...     variance=1.5, backlog_history=2, unskilled_score=.5)

We specified a number of optional parameters that we'll see in action
later:

variance
   How many times the pool mean backlog we'll let a worker's backlog
   rise above the minimum backlog [#almostminimum]_ before we look for
   another worker.  The default is 1.

backlog_history
   The (approximate) number of requests to include in the mean backlog
   for a worker. The default is 9.

   The pool also has a backlog history, which is the product of the
   worker backlog_history and the number of workers.

unskilled_score
   The score to assign to unskilled workers. The default is 1.


The get method is used to get a worker from the pool.  A request class
and an optional timeout is passed. (The timeout is mainly useful for
testing.)

    >>> pool.get('foo', 0.0)

We didn't get a worker (we timed out), because we haven't added one.

    >>> class Worker:
    ...     def __init__(self, name):
    ...         self.name = name
    ...     def __repr__(self):
    ...         return self.name
    ...     def __cmp__(self, other):
    ...         return cmp(self.name, other.name)
    ...     def __hash__(self):
    ...         return hash(self.name)
    ...     def handle(self, *args):
    ...         pass

    >>> w1 = Worker('w1')

    >>> pool.new_resume(w1, {})

    >>> pool.get('foo', 0.0)
    w1

This time, we got the one we registered.

If we create another and register it, we'll still get the original:

   >>> w2 = Worker('w2')
   >>> pool.new_resume(w2, {})

   >>> pool.get('foo')
   w1

 This is because w1 is known to be good at handling foo requests.

 We'll get w2 if we pick a different request class:

    >>> pool.get('bar')
    w2

 We're gonna be white box and look at the pool data structures from
 time to time.

    >>> pool # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Request classes:
      bar: w2(0.5,1.0)
      foo: w1(0.5,1.57...)
    Backlogs:
      overall backlog: 3 Decayed: 2.08... Avg: 1.04...
      1: [w2]
      2: [w1]

Here, we can see that w1 is used for the foo class and w2 for the bar
class.  In the request classes, the worker's score and it's decayed
backlog is shown in parentheses.  We see that both workers have a score
of 1.0.  This is the default score for new workers.  We'll say more
about this later.

The decayed backlog, for the pool, and for workers, is an "average"
backlog over a backlog history, which is a configuration parameter.

Let's add another worker:

    >>> w3 = Worker('w3')
    >>> pool.new_resume(w3, {})

and make another foo request:

    >>> [pool.get('foo') for i in range(2)]
    [w1, w1]

    >>> pool # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Request classes:
      bar: w2(0.5,1.0)
      foo: w1(0.5,2.85...)
    Backlogs:
      overall backlog: 5 Decayed: 3.21... Avg: 1.07...
      0: [w3]
      1: [w2]
      4: [w1]

Even though we still had a worker with no backlog, we kept sending
requests to w1.  This is because w1 hasn't reached the maximum
backlog, which is:

   variance * max(2, pool_mean_backlog)

So now, w1 has reached it's maximum backlog.  If
we make another foo request, we'll start using w3:

    >>> [pool.get('foo') for i in range(10)]
    [w3, w3, w3, w3, w1, w3, w1, w3, w1, w3]

    >>> pool # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Request classes:
      bar: w2(0.5,1.0)
      foo: w1(0.5,5.07...), w3(0.5,5.07...)
    Backlogs:
      overall backlog: 15 Decayed: 9.61... Avg: 3.20...
      1: [w2]
      7: [w1, w3]

Something interesting happened here.  After several requests, the
pools switched back and forth between w1 and w3.  It never switched to
w2.  This is because, as the backlogs for w1 and w3 increased, so did
the mean backlog.  This is useful, because it prevents a single
request class from taking over the entire pool.  Let's see what
happens when we add some new workers:

    >>> w4 = Worker('w4')
    >>> pool.new_resume(w4, {})
    >>> w5 = Worker('w5')
    >>> pool.new_resume(w5, {})

    >>> pool # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Request classes:
      bar: w2(0.5,1.0)
      foo: w1(0.5,5.07...), w3(0.5,5.07...)
    Backlogs:
      overall backlog: 15 Decayed: 9.61... Avg: 1.92...
      0: [w4, w5]
      1: [w2]
      7: [w1, w3]

    >>> [pool.get('foo') for i in range(2)]
    [w5, w5]

The new workers caused the overall mean to drop and when we got a foo
request, it went to the newest new worker.  The subsequent request
went to that worker because it was skilled and had a fairly low backlog.

When a worker is done doing its work, we put it back in the pool:

    >>> for i in range(8):
    ...     pool.put(w1)
    >>> for i in range(8):
    ...     pool.put(w3)

    >>> pool # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Request classes:
      bar: w2(0.5,1.0)
      foo: w1(0.5,2.29...), w3(0.5,2.29...), w5(0.5,1.57...)
    Backlogs:
      overall backlog: 1 Decayed: 8.41... Avg: 1.68...
      0: [w1, w3, w4]
      1: [w2]
      2: [w5]

Now, when we get a worker, we'll get w1.

    >>> pool.get('foo', 0.0)
    w1

Now that we've done some work, let's update the resumes.  This will
normally be done by workers periodically, after collecting performance
data.

    >>> pool.new_resume(w1, {'foo': 6.0})
    >>> pool.new_resume(w2, {'bar': 2.0, 'foo': 2.0})
    >>> pool.new_resume(w3, {'foo': 3.8})

    >>> pool # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Request classes:
      bar: w2(2.0,1.0)
      foo: w5(0.5,1.57...), w2(2.0,1.0), w3(3.8,2.29...), w1(6.0,1.96...)
    Backlogs:
      overall backlog: 2 Decayed: 8.00... Avg: 1.60...
      0: [w3, w4]
      1: [w1, w2]
      2: [w5]

    >>> pool.get('foo')
    w3
    >>> pool.get('foo')
    w1
    >>> pool.get('foo')
    w1

    >>> pool # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Request classes:
      bar: w2(2.0,1.0)
      foo: w5(0.5,1.57...), w2(2.0,1.0), w3(3.8,1.96...), w1(6.0,2.23...)
    Backlogs:
      overall backlog: 5 Decayed: 7.31... Avg: 1.46...
      0: [w4]
      1: [w2, w3]
      2: [w5]
      3: [w1]

    >>> pool.get('foo')
    w3
    >>> pool.get('foo')
    w1
    >>> pool.get('foo')
    w3

    >>> pool.put(w1)
    >>> pool.put(w3)
    >>> pool.put(w3)
    >>> pool.put(w3)
    >>> pool.put(w3)
    >>> pool.put(w3)
    >>> pool # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Request classes:
      bar: w2(2.0,1.0)
      foo: w5(0.5,1.57...), w2(2.0,1.0), w3(3.8,1.40...), w1(6.0,2.75...)
    Backlogs:
      overall backlog: 2 Decayed: 6.39... Avg: 1.27...
      0: [w3, w4]
      1: [w2]
      2: [w5]
      3: [w1]

    >>> [pool.get('foo') for i in range(5)]
    [w3, w3, w1, w3, w2]

Worker disconnect
=================

When a worker disconnect, it's removed from the pool:

    >>> pool.remove(w1)
    >>> pool.remove(w3)
    >>> pool # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Request classes:
      bar: w2(2.0,1.57...)
      foo: w5(0.5,1.57...), w2(2.0,1.57...)
    Backlogs:
      overall backlog: 0 Decayed: 5.57... Avg: 1.85...
      0: [w4]
      2: [w2, w5]

Updating worker settings
========================

    >>> pool = zc.resumelb.lb.Pool()
    >>> pool.new_resume(w1, {'foo': 6.0})
    >>> pool.new_resume(w2, {'bar': 2.0, 'foo': 2.0})
    >>> pool.new_resume(w3, {'foo': 3.8})
    >>> pool.variance, pool.backlog_history, pool.unskilled_score
    (1.0, 9, 1.0)
    >>> pool.worker_decay, pool.decay # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    (0.944..., 0.981...)

    >>> pool.update_settings(dict(variance=2.0))
    >>> pool.variance, pool.backlog_history, pool.unskilled_score
    (2.0, 9, 1.0)
    >>> pool.worker_decay, pool.decay # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    (0.944..., 0.981...)

    >>> pool.update_settings(
    ... dict(variance=3.0, backlog_history=6, unskilled_score=.25))
    >>> pool.variance, pool.backlog_history, pool.unskilled_score
    (3.0, 6, 0.25)
    >>> pool.worker_decay, pool.decay # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    (0.916..., 0.972...)

Note that settings revert to their default values when not specified:

    >>> pool.update_settings({})
    >>> pool.variance, pool.backlog_history, pool.unskilled_score
    (1.0, 9, 1.0)
    >>> pool.worker_decay, pool.decay # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    (0.944..., 0.981...)

Settings are automatically coerced to their expected types:

    >>> pool.update_settings(
    ... dict(variance=3, backlog_history=6.2, unskilled_score=2))
    >>> pool.variance, pool.backlog_history, pool.unskilled_score
    (3.0, 6, 2.0)

    >>> pool.update_settings(
    ... dict(variance='2', backlog_history='7', unskilled_score='1'))
    >>> pool.variance, pool.backlog_history, pool.unskilled_score
    (2.0, 7, 1.0)

Using new workers
=================

Under heavy load, we should be able to add a worker and have it get
used immediately.

    >>> pool.update_settings(dict(variance=1))
    >>> pool.new_resume(w1, {'bar': 2.0})
    >>> pool.new_resume(w2, {'bar': 2.0})
    >>> pool.new_resume(w3, {'bar': 2.0})
    >>> _ = [pool.get('bar') for i in range(30)]

    >>> pool # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Request classes:
      bar: w1(2.0,5.96898355541), w2(2.0,5.96898355541), w3(2.0,5.96898355541)
      foo: 
    Backlogs:
      overall backlog: 30 Decayed: 16.8930595654 Avg: 5.63101985512
      10: [w1, w2, w3]

Now, we'll add a new worker:

    >>> w6 = Worker('w6')
    >>> pool.new_resume(w6, {})

And wen we make a request, it will go to the new worker:

    >>> pool.get('bar')
    w6

Note that we used a variance of 1.  Unfortunately, if we use a higher
variance, new individual workers won't get added.  However, using so
low a variance will tend to cause work to spread out over multiple
workers, rather than being limited to a few.


.. [#almostminimum] We use the backlog of the least-recently-used
   worker as an approximation of the minumun backlog.
